This application stands as a bridge between the abundance of unused ingredients in households and the growing need for healthier, more sustainable eating practices. It was created on Android Studios, as a mobile phone application. Using the emulator within the IDE, we were able to test and create a fully funcitoning app.

## Project Description

Our project was inspired by the ambitious United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically aligning with the objectives outlined in Goals 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). Recognizing the complexity of these global challenges, which extend beyond the realm of simple just technological solutions, our hackathon team aimed to contribute to these goals through a practical approach: promoting healthy eating habits and minimizing food waste.

To this end, we developed a user-friendly application designed to address the issue of food waste at an individual level. Our app empowers users to combat food waste by allowing users to enter ingredients they need to use imminently—particularly those nearing expiration. Upon input, the app dynamically generates a selection of 12 appealing recipes, complete with images. Users can then click on an image to be directed to the full recipe on the original website, providing a seamless and intuitive experience.

This project was brought to life using Flutter and Dart—technologies from Google. Flutter, an open-source UI software development kit, coupled with Dart, a versatile programming language, enabled us to craft a sleek, responsive mobile application. This endeavor was not only our first foray into utilizing Flutter and Dart but also our inaugural experience in creating a fully functional mobile app.

The journey of building this app has been immensely educational, offering us invaluable insights into mobile app development and the intricacies of Flutter and Dart. As we look to the future, we are excited to enhance our app's functionality further. Our next steps include enabling users to input multiple ingredients simultaneously and introducing a feature to capture images of the ingredients they wish to utilize. Through these enhancements, we aim to make our app even more accessible and effective in promoting sustainable living practices.
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
